<h3>Madison Park is home to an overwhelmingly large BIPOC student body coming from generally low-income families.

<h5>U.S. Census data indicate that in Massachusetts the median income for Black households is only 56% of White households and that of Latinx households barely 46%.  White household median net assets in 2015 amounted to $247,500, compared to $8 for U.S. born Black households and $3,000 for Hispanics.</h5>
<h5>A significant factor underpinning these disparities is the legacy of discrimination in the labor market.  But as we confront such discrimination, inequality in educational opportunity is becoming an even greater factor.  Differences in educational attainment by race and ethnicity affect what jobs are available to job seekers and thus determine the income an individual can expect to earn.</h5>
<p>By most accounts, providing exceptionally high quality education and training to Boston high school students (as well as adults who wish to learn new skills to them qualify for better jobs) is the most powerful tool we have to help close the racial/ethnic income gap and improve the asset position of Bostonâ€™s Black and Latinx (BIPOC) households.</p>
<p>As the only Technical/Vocational High School in the City of Boston, Madison Park is providing its students with the academic education and vocational training to allow them to enter the labor force in a wide range of well-paying occupations.
